      #
      # Adds methods to exploits for building buffers used in
      # buffer overflows.
      #
      # ## Target Parameters
      #
      # The buffer overflow helper uses the following target parameters:
      #
      # * `ip` (**required**) - The Instruction Pointer (IP) to overwrite
      #   on the stack.
      # * `bp` - The Base Pointer (BP) to overwrite on the stack.
      # * `buffer_length` - The length of the buffer to overflow.
      # * `stack_frame_repeat` - The number of times to repeat the
      #   overwritten stack frame.
      #
      # ## Payloads
      #
      # Uses the {Payloads::Shellcode} payload by default.
      #
      module BufferOverflow
        # The buffer to use for the buffer overflow.
